 I developed a machine learning model using logistic regression, random forest, linear SVM, RBF SVM, gradient boosting, decision tree, and KNN algorithms to classify emails as either spam or not spam. Through experimentation and evaluation, the gradient boosting algorithm emerged as the optimal model,
exhibiting superior performance in accurately identifying email categories.
